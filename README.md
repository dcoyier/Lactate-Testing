I run cross country and track at Carleton College, and I've been interested in the science behind running for the past 3 years. 

I have conducted ~10 blood lactate tests (including tests on myself, and high school teammates) to determine Aerobic Threshold (AeT) and Anaerobic Threshold (AnT) heart rate values (HR) to better allot training volume. You will find code that I used to calculate AeT and AnT HR here.

The difference between Lactate_Threshold_Calculator_Full_Functionality.ipynb and ...Preview.ipynb is that the full functionality version includes an interactive chart to modify polynomial degrees/regularization so that the user can visually find the curve that best fits the lactate data.
