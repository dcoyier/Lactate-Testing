I run cross country and track at Carleton College, and I've been interested in the science behind running for the past 3 years. 

I have conducted ~10 blood lactate tests (including tests on myself, and high school teammates) to determine Aerobic Threshold (AeT) and Anaerobic Threshold (AnT) heart rate values (HR) to better organize training. You will find code that I used to calculate AeT and AnT HR here.
